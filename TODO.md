# To Do

An list of features to be implemented before the v1.0.0 release.

- [x] Add options to solve without a given variable
- [x] Add options under each variable to calculate for the desired variable
  - [x] Distance: *accel, init. vel, final vel, time*
  - [x] Final velocity: *dist, accel, init. vel, time*
  - [x] Initial velocity: *dist, accel, final vel, time*
  - [x] Acceleration: *dist, init. vel, final vel, time*
  - [x] Time: *dist, accel, init. vel, final vel*
- [x] Give user option to save data after calculation to a variable
- [X] Give user option to restart program
- [x] Collapse ⌊PHVAR after completion
