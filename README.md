# The TI-84+CE Physics Bible Program

This is a program designed for the **TI-84+CE**, to help you solve for different key values needed in a variety of physics equations. The equations calculated in the program are derivations of the 5 equations of uniformly accelerated motion in one dimension, which can be viewed [here](https://i.imgur.com/5MSZ8Nv.jpg). This program can solve for any of the following variables if 3 others are known (measurement units in parentheses):

- Acceleration (in m/sÂ²)
- Displacement (in m)
- Initial velocity (in m/s)
- Final velocity (in m/s)
- Time (in s)

This program is written in TI-BASIC, and will work from RAM or the Archive. Due to the size of the program (12 119 bytes on device, without the automatically generated list ```PHVAR```), it is recommended to store the program in the Archive. Although this program is capable of running on any TI-83/84 graphing calculator (except the TI-84+C SE), it is *not recommended*, as the text is optimized for a larger colour display and will wrap on top of itself on black and white screens.

To download the program, follow [this link](https://github.com/cam-rod/TI84CE-physics-bible/releases) and select  your preferred version, or click [here for a direct download](https://github.com/cam-rod/TI84-colour-physics-bible/releases/download/v1.0.0/PHYSBBLE.8xp). Then, head over to the download site for the [TI Connect CE software](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) and follow the instructions in the guidebook to send the program to your TI-84+CE. Finally, to run the program, press the ```pgrm``` button, and then select the program called ```PHYSBBLE```.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please follow the guidelines below:

- All pull requests should be rebased onto the latest release version on the master branch first.
- Test your changes **and** general functionality on a TI-84+CE before submitting a pull request.
- Bug reports should include as much detail as possible; move the program into RAM and use ```Goto``` on the error page to provide context.
