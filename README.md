# The TI-84+CE Physics Bible Program

This is a program designed for the **TI-84+CE** to help you solve for different key values needed in a variety of physics equations. The equations calculated in the program are derivations of the 5 equations of uniformly accelerated motion in one dimension, which can be viewed [here](https://i.imgur.com/5MSZ8Nv.jpg). This program can solve for any of the following variables if 3 others are known:

- Acceleration (in m/sÂ²)
- Displacement (in m)
- Initial velocity (in m/s)
- Final velocity (in m/s)
- Time (in s)

This program is written in TI-BASIC, and currently under development. Feel free to suggest improvements and I'll look at implementing them. To view current progress towards v1.0.0, [click here](TODO.md).
