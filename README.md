# The TI-84+CE Physics Bible Program

This is a program designed for the **TI-84+ CE** to help you solve for different key values needed in a variety of physics equations.The equations calculated in the program are derivations of the 5 equations of uniformly accelerated motion in one dimension, which can be viewed [here](https://i.imgur.com/5MSZ8Nv.jpg). This program can solve for any of the following variables if 3 others are known:

* Acceleration
* Displacement
* Initial velocity
* Final velocity
* Time

This program is written in TI-BASIC, and currently under development. Feel free to suggest improvements and I'll look at implementing them.
