# Differences

The key difference between this program and the original for the TI-84+CE is the replacement of the incompatible command ```Wait``` with the following command:

```
Repeat getKey
End
```

This requires the user to press ```enter``` at each paused screen, so additional prompts are also included. This also results in an increased size of the program by 1 372 bytes.
