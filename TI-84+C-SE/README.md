# Differences

The key difference between this program and the original for the TI-84+CE is the replacement of the incompatible command ```Wait``` with the classic command ```Pause```. This requires the user to press ```enter``` at each pause screen, so additional prompts are also included. This also results in an increased size of the program by 1 149 bytes.
